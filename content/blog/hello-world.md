## Why.

To be honest with you, I'm not really sure, I do stuff sometimes, but all my life I've been absolutely the worst at writing them down, I hope having this blog site up running and functional will ~~force~~inspire me to write and share some more about some of the stuff I do. While most of my projects will have pretty demo sites, I hope this blog will serve as place for me to really describe the nitty gritty of the problems and challenges I face, and what I learn along the way.

## Who. 

I'm Arjun, a currently 21 year robotics senior who's writing this post after pulling my 3rd or 4th an all nighter this weekend for absolutely no reason, I do a lot of things, (mainly robots and software) but other stuff too, like rock climbing, swimming, art, hopefully blacksmithing, and mainly lots and lots of impulsive desicions. As the name of this site says I'm not an adult, honestly I don't think I'll ever be, but this site exists to document what I learn over the course of my life and maybe you'll find something cool here, who knows. 

That's all you really need to know until next time. 

-Arjun
